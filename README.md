### Missing features

Unfortunately, Microsoft's own Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) UI framework has undesirable performance and responsiveness, and the standard WPF TextBox leaves a lot to be desired even for plaintext editing.

- **Closing the app with unsaved changes shows no prompt and discards the changes!** This is intentional, as I use Plaintext as a scratch pad, but may be undesirable. The editor was supposed to have an auto-saving feature so you could restore unsaved changes, but it was never needed.
- Replace
- Printing
- The Save button gets in the way sometimes.
- Some (Unicode) symbols aren't monospaced / correctly grid aligned. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
- Sometimes it takes a long time to start up, even on an SSD. Thanks, Microsoft.
